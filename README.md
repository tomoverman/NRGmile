# NRGmile
An accurate and customizable code for determine the difficulty and energy mile rating of a given route.

## Introduction
Traditionally, the hiking and running community has relied on anecdotal evidence for determining the difficult of a route.
Later on, a basic measure of the energy miles spent on a given route was developed by Paul Petzoldt based off the overall distance traveled and the elevation gain.
However, this measure did not take into account many important factors that affect performance, including: (1) variations in elevation of the projected hiking distances, (2) consideration for negative (downwards) slopes, (3) the various terrains one might encounter e.g dirt, snow, sleet, etc., (4) weight of backpack, and (5) individual differences in ability.

**The focus of this project is building a more accurate model for determining route difficulty rating.** By combining exercise science studies with numerical methods, we hope to achieve the first step in developing a robust difficulty measurement system.
